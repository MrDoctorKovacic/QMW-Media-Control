# QMW-Media-Control

**This is defunct, as it depends too many disjoint features. The latest running Media Player is now part of the MDroid project [here](https://github.com/MrDoctorKovacic/MDroid-MediaPlayer).**

A very simple bluetooth media controller for my car. It's my first React Native app adapted from my earlier [Web Media Control](https://github.com/MrDoctorKovacic/web-media-control/blob/master/index.php), which was attempting to mimic Apple CarPlay. Still uses the [media controller](https://github.com/MrDoctorKovacic/web-media-control/blob/master/media.php) from the previous project, just not the front-end.

Only tested on Android, iOS likely won't build.

`npm install && react-native run-android`
